```javascript
// MyComponent.jsx
<div className="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">My Component</h2>
  <p>Some content here.</p>
</div>
```

This code snippet will cause an unexpected result because the `bg-gray-100` class does not exist in my Tailwind CSS configuration.

**Error:**

The class `bg-gray-100` will not be applied resulting in the background color not being set.

This is because the default Tailwind CSS configuration does not include the `gray-100` color.  It assumes you've customized your `tailwind.config.js` file to generate that specific shade of gray.
